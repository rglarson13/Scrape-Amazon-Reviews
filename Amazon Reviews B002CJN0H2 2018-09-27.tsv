1	Rate	Great	4.0 out of 5 stars	on September 26, 2018
2	Works well	filters dust and works great.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 26, 2018
3	Years and years of Filtrete only and now, no longer	Quality has turned to least possible. I must change out near every two weeks as there is so little inside to gather dust. That is NO VALUE to me. LIke spending money for nothing. I changed old version (was same from many, many years) once a month soiled or not, now it's mandatory to change every 2 weeks since they have such little inside to hold dust. Sadly I leave and will NOT return-They just don't get it. DO NOT try to get everyone (I need 2 sizes) to change to your $10-$16 filters that are NO BETTER than these were for a long time. GREED will put you under and yes, you are doing it everywhere but most can't afford a one month for the higher price, I will NOT afford when I must change every two weeks so cost is as high as you want due to reducing quality.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on September 25, 2018

57	THE WORST A.C. FILTER IN 50 YEARS.	These are the worst a.c. Filters I have ever purchased in 50 years.  They are absolutely JUNK. I rn out of the ones I usually buy and sued one of these. 2 day latter my wife asked what the whistling noise was on the AC vent. I looked up and the filter was being sucked up into the air intake. And yes I did have it inserted correctly with the air flow arrows pointing in the correct direction. The problem is that they skimped on the frame for the filter so I collapses when it is h in fir sucked through it. The moron who come up with this ldea must have got his engineering degree from “ I’m Stupid” tech school. They saved money buy built a crap product. Shame on 3M for selling this junk. What a waste of money. Buyer beware!	1.0 out of 5 stars	on August 19, 2018

167	Flimsy construction not suitable for modern HVAC.	These are cheaply made.  Two days of use and the first one started whistling.  I switched to another one and it whistles too.  These filters are not sturdy enough for a new HVAC.  The frame is thin cardboard with a triangle cross-section and the metal mesh is too flimsy to keep the "pleated" filter media flat.  The old 3M filters were sturdy, but I no longer a trust the 3M brand.  I'll be looking for something else.These filters are better than merv 1 fiberglass filters, trapping more dust and some allergens.  They might be adequate in an old HVAC or furnace.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on July 7, 2018

219	Efficient Furnace Filters	Since we have a Bryant propane fired furnace/heat pump/air conditioner; the installer, My Plumber, strongly recommended replacing this filter each month. We are very satisfied with these filters.Sincerely,Bill Warnock	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 14, 2018

221	Buy six and mark your calendar!	Great filters at a great price. I selected a 6 pack to save money and have already marked our calendar in the kitchen when we need to replace them. The A/C intake immediately stopped making that whistling sound which means we definitely left it longer than recommended.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 13, 2018
222	Cheap but they work and provide great airflow	You'll read a bunch of reviews that say these filters don't have the best construction, and they're right.  But it is good enough and as long as you don't allow them to become caked with gunk they should be just fine.  I change mine once a month and don't allow them to get real dirty and they work like a champ.  The lower rating is actually a plus for me.  It provides better airflow through the system and is able to capture the stuff that would truly harm my AC unit.Will I be buying these again.  Yes, I will.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 12, 2018

I'll have to send this back again and get another refund, hopefully if others order this they will have better luck.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on June 1, 2018
251	misleading labeling -- doesn't fit in my HVAC unit	I ordered this size based on the measurements listed on the filter already in the HVAC. What I now know $33 later is that actual size varies, and is written in tiny print on the filters (and nowhere in the Amazon product description). The actual size of these filters is 15 11/16 inches by 24 11/16 inches by 13/16 inches. Apparently this is larger than the actual size of most 16x25x1 filters, so they do not fit in my HVAC unit.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on May 31, 2018

298	These serve a basic purpose at a nominal price.	Air filters in general are very over priced, I purchased these at greatly reduced cost and feel like they will meet my current needs. I would generally recommend a better air filter for most air systems, these just catch the most basic dust/dirt.I bought these filters knowing they are the most basic kind, my current air system is over 30 years old and will most def have to be replaced soon so I feel no need to buy the higher end filters (which again I would generally recommend). These serve a basic purpose at a nominal price.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on April 25, 2018

378	Doesn't filter out much, and cheaper cost is negated by how often you have to replace it	I wish I'd done more homework before buying this product.  It's VERY basic and flimsy, and when you add the cost of replacing it every 30 days, it isn't even cheap.  My fault for not investigating the meaning of the various ratings and figuring out the actual cost considering how often it has to be replaced.  The filters with higher ratings have to be replaced every 90 days and many end up being less expensive and more effective.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on February 9, 2018

385	Great filter, change more than it recomends you'll be thankful	Pretty standard filter.  The price nice since we have to replace them monthly.  When I first moved out I never would replace these and dust would build up steadily.  Now that I'm older and home owner I religiously replace them monthly.  Keeps the dust down in the house, clears most the germs from having the windows shut all winter, and is easier on the furnace.  I have seen filters that haven't been changed in a long time and they are so dirty nothing can get through them.  Remember to change regularly.  I asked my furnace guy if they last 3 months and he said to change monthly.  The 3 month rule is if your not running it all the time and we run the furnace everyday all winter, and most of the summer.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 5, 2018

Pretty bad quality, even from a cheaper product. By buying cheaper I, expected a lower level of filtration, not areas that are wide open.

484	GOOD FILTER FOR THE MONEY	Some of the reviews have been negative for these filters, but I took a chance because of the need for less expensive filters because where I live even the expensive ones load up fast. So I bought them and compared them to the filter I had and the measurements are the same. Being a little less on the MERV the HVAC does seem to work less to pull air through. So far the filter is getting about the same discard time, but way cheaper than I was paying. So I am happy with these filters.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 27, 2017
485	Not doing its job!	I just got someone to come in and clean my system and I've been using this for a year now, ordering it and changing it every month. But when the guy took out the system to clean, I nearly passed out! It was dusty, dirty and HORRIBLE! The guy said that is circulating back in our air and we are breathing this. The filter is not doing a dang thing! So not buying this anymore!	1.0 out of 5 stars	on October 27, 2017

Change every 30 days.MERV 8 / MPR 600 / FPR 5 (Green)Captures lint, household dust, pollen, dust mites, mold spores. Change every 90 days.MERV 11 / MPR 1000-1200 / FPR 7 (Red)Captures lint, household dust, pollen, dust mites, mold spores, smoke, smog, cough/sneezes, pet dander. Change every 90 days.MERV 13 / MPR 1500-1900 / FPR 10 (Blue)Captures lint, household dust, pollen, dust mites, mold spores, smoke, smog, cough/sneezes, pet dander, virus carriers, odors, bacteria. Change every 90 days.Note - the suggested time to change is just that - a suggestion. Some homes will need it more frequently depending on conditions. Just take a look at the filter every few weeks, and if it's dirty, change it.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on August 9, 2017

719	Never had any problems with these. Inexpensive filters allow for more frequent replacement.	Second time for purchasing these - they work fine for me and are much less expensive than the ones form the hardware store. Personally I've found cleaning and replacing the filter more frequently is more effective than buying a more expensive filter. These seem to be the perfect balance of airflow vs filtering for our home, which includes multiple animals (and at least one person) who shed a good bit of hair which shows up in clumps in these filters. Dust level is manageable, and allergies issues are minimal.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 29, 2017

722	Great price on filters	So I usually buy my filters at Lowes, but when I went in they were out of stock and I could not even find a place for them anymore. This was not the first time they were out of stock on what I needed. I decided to see what I could find on Amazon and these came up near the top of my search. I had to do the math since I usually buy a 3 pack and they were cheaper than the ones I usually buy. I got them and put one right in and it has been working great. These are actually better built than the ones I was buying so I am very happy. Definitely a good deal if you can wait a couple days. I will be back for more.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 27, 2017

730	You get what you pay for	I read other reviews that warned that these were cheap. I ordered them anyway.Boy, are they cheap. And flimsy. We live in the desert & have a ton of DUST. As I was unpacking them from the box, I noticed that they only capture 50% of dust, compared with the other (more expensive) styles. Had I looked carefully at the pictures of the filters, and zoomed in to see the specs closely, I wouldn't have purchased them in the first place.I returned these, and purchased an allergen reducing style.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on March 22, 2017

745	Good enough!	Good enough filter...I have to fight it out of my furnace when it's time to change but I think that is more my furnace than the filter.

747	Decent, but not so easy to install.	Very tricky to install in my furnace. It kept going wonky as I was sliding it in, and did not want to stay in the groove that it was supposed to be in. I finally got it right, but I don't look forward to having to change it.This might be unfair, because possibly this is a user error since I am a newbie, and possibly I just have a really challenging old furnace. I can't say. But the plastic-framed filter that came in my furnace went in and out of that groove a bit easier.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on March 9, 2017

828	Spot on Fit - Clean air in the home:-)	These 3M filters are definitely the ticket!!Bought these as the bulk package here on amazon and as recommended by the installer of our A/c unit. The price was unbeatable!!! Local big box stores couldn't come close to matching the price. Quality and construction seems to be quite good and we have even noticed we can squeeze almost another 30 days of use out of them versus the installer/unit recommended maintenance replacement schedule; which equates to our using one less per year.The fit is spot on and the filtration capacity seems to keep the air quality in our home fresh and allergen free (and for those of you that live in NC you know how the pollen gets down here!!!)I'll definitely be purchasing these once again when we run out.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on November 19, 2016

857	Newer Product too Flimsy	Have to agree with those who report that this product isn't as good as it used to be.I had found these to be very satisfactory and a decent buy for a good spun-paper filter.However, the filters in my most recent batch have the nasty habit of bowing upward in the airflow---the paper frame is not rigid enough along the sides.  Most filters bow up a little, but these actually pull upward enough to create gaps along the edges.  They're not big gaps, but I don't think there should be any.  When I remove them I've noticed that the cardboard is creased along the edges.  Too thin.It makes me wonder about 3M products in general.  I recently bought a whole box of 3M face masks that do the same thing---they suck in against my nose and create gaps around the edges.  I was really disappointed as I always thought you got a little more for what you paid to get the 3M brand.  Doesn't seem to be the case.Anyway...I'm going back to Nordic Pure filters.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on October 21, 2016

Slightly less than the pleated ones I get at the grocery store (forgot brand name - around $6 or $7 and I need 2 at a time), but the grocery store brand is much better. These are absolute garbage - flimsy and crummy. I hope I can send them back through prime. I like the micro, but too expensive through Amazon.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on October 15, 2016

887	Time again to change my air filters.	It's that time again........time to change the air filters.  Something that I know is out of sight and often out of mind, but something very important for my health as well as the health of my air conditioning system.  And so, I begrudgingly fork out the dough for more filters.  I must say though that it is nice to be able to pick them up on Amazon in bulk and at a lower price than I find in the big box stores.  I settle for the MPR 300 filter because I just can't justify spending more on a filter that I am going to throw away in 3 months time.  This filter has always met my needs and kept my air quality in check. It's only when I remove the old filter that I am reminded of just why it is so important to change them in the first place.  It's a good habit to get into and if you schedule it to coincide with the change of seasons, then it's easy to remember as well.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 24, 2016

948	At $4.50 for 90 days, it is a bargain for a high quality filter	High quality yet economical filters.  I have been buying these for about 4 years.  Since we don't have anyone with specific allergies at home, these are the right filters for us.  They easily last the full 90-day cycle which makes these the most economical out there.  At about $4.50 each, they are actually cheaper than the cheapest filters.  Usually the least expensive filters I see are in the $1-$2 range.  They sell in packs of 12, but they only go for 30 days.  For less than that, I figure I can get this 3M filter with much higher quality.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 31, 2016

I do that, but have to admit there are some months that the a/c or heat are not on at all and I lengthen is a half or whole month then - completely depending on usage. That has maintained our home's service for 12 years so far. It's also so easy instead of washing those others and waiting for them to dry to put back or to put away if you replaced with another.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 25, 2016

I find the filters tend to flex and lose their rigidity once placed inside the furnace. Overall the filter material itself is effective in filtering particulate from the air flowing through the system but the cardboard boarder that provides structure to the filter is sub-par in construction.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on May 1, 2016

Not only is the construction totally different in a rather flimsy manner, the surface area of filtering is DECREASED by a full 25%!!!Should have returned them and bought something else, but I will NEVER buy again.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on May 1, 2016

The return air will suck this flimsy filter into my air duct and it would cause problem. Now I can't return it. Am screwed...I warned everybody about this product. It's the lowest grade from Filtrete.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on April 30, 2016

990	3M MPR 300 is MERV 6 on a comparison scale	It does not flow all that good compared to other brands that actually filter better. Barely pleated, some spots you can actually see through. The filtering material is stamped to the intake side of the frame, 1" wide frame but only .25" is utilized, 12 semi-pleats almost flat. The ones I used bulged/buckled out on the first day. Very cheaply made for a supposed pleated filter.Found one in the package with a piece of the wire showing on the blower side and another with an actual hole. If you want better flow and filtration get a different brand. Unfortunately for me it was a waste of money, had to put the rest in the trash!	2.0 out of 5 stars	on April 12, 2016

I usually buy from the local store and I have probably been getting the next level up in filter quality. (3M sells multiple styles and these are the "Basic Dust Filter.") These arrived in a big box with another order sitting on top of them. I thought perhaps they got crushed, but that wasn't the issue. The filters are not as sturdy as the ones I usually get. The pleats are somewhat crushed and not all pleats are exactly the same size and shape. The filters I typically buy have very uniform pleats and hold their shape; they have more strength than these. If I buy them again, I'll look for the next higher level of quality.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on March 20, 2016

1007	Updated 2016 Technical Data: Basic Dust vs Ultra Allergen on pressure drop and MERV ratings	I've been trying to find out which filter would be best for my A/C. My top concern was not to put too much load on the HVAC fan given the age and to reduce electricity consumption. I always assumed it was the 600MPR Dust & Pollen or the 300 MPR Dust. So I asked 3M for the data on the Filtrete filter and this is what I got.SUMMARY: The Ultra Allergen 1500MPR (for 1 inch depth HVAC) is the LOWEST pressure at 0.15 (vs .20 for the MPR 600). So it didn't make sense for me to go for MPR 300, MPR 600 or MPR 1000.The complete response from 3M below:Generally speaking, for most residential HVAC systems, the filter will become restrictive when it reaches a .5 pressure drop.All of our filter media fibers are polypropylene and polyolefin plastic which will remove particles that measure 3 to 10 microns.Microparticle Performance Rating (MPR), MERV Ratings, and pressure drops are as follows:Elite Extra 24003-10 microns - 96%MERV 13pressure drop .21Elite Allergen 22003-10 microns - 94%MERV 12pressure drop .18Maximum/Ultimate Allergen 19003-10 microns - 93%MERV 12pressure drop .16Allergen Deep Pleat 1550 (4").3-10 microns 97%MERV 12pressure drop .12Ultra Allergen 1500310 microns - 90%MERV 12pressure drop .15Odor Reduction 12003-10 microns - 85%MERV 11pressure drop .24Micro Allergen 10003-10 microns - 80%MERV 11pressure drop .21Dust & Pollen 6003-10 microns - 65%MERV 7pressure drop .20Dust Reduction 3003-10 microns -35%MERV 6pressure drop .20Flat Panel3-10 microns -5%MERV 1Pressure Drop .08Pressure drop is a measure of air flow resistance. It is measured by inches of Water Column (W.C.) at 300 feet per minute (FPM).Clean/new filters are not restrictive to air flow. Filters will become restrictive if they are not changed when needed. A filter's life is actually determined by the user's living conditions and will vary for every user. Generally speaking, we recommend changing filters approximately every 3 mo nths.To determine when the filter needs to be change, we suggest holding it up to the light. When you cannot see light through the filter, it is ready to be changed, even if it is before 3 months.If you are concerned about airflow, you might want to use the filter with a lower pressure drop.If you have a high velocity furnace with high fan speed, you may need to change the filters more frequently, every 1.5 to 2 months.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on March 14, 2016

1079	Not The Same Quality 3M Product I Expected	I have been using these filters for years now with no issues. The last batch I purchased a few months ago was packed differently than the filters I've purchased on Amazon and other stores over the years. These were not individually wrapped, but instead were wrapped as a six pack. No big deal, as it is environmentally friendly packing.The first thing I noticed upon opening the package was that the paperboard used to frame out the filter was soft and flimsy. I wasn't too worried because there is a wire mesh holding the actual element in place, so I was pretty sure this was not going to be sucked up into my system as long as I installed it with air flow in the proper direction.Upon my heater turning in, I noticed a sound coming from my intake vent that I never heard before. It sounded like the filter was flexing when the fan turned on, and then again when the fan turned off. I immediately removed the filter and checked that the airflow arrows were pointing in the right direction. When I saw that all was OK, I put in another new filter. The flexing sound was still there.I have used five of the six filters in the package, and they have all made noise whenever the fan turned on or off. While the filter appears to be doing its job, I feel that I should not be alerted every time my heater turns on and off. I did try another brand filter that I purchased from Home Depot, and there was no flexing sound. It seems as though the manufacturing quality of this product has diminished slightly, maybe loosening up the tolerances and allowing the filter to flex? I'm not sure if it's just this lot or if it's across the board with 3M filters. I'll probably use another brand going forward.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on November 29, 2015
1080	Work fine for basic dust & dander.  Need changing more often than other brands.	These are pretty decent filters as far as basic dust and pet related dander and dirt. With six dogs in the house and dual central a/c & heat systems, I have two air returns - one on each end of the house. I change the filters every 30 days without fail. It seems like this particular version needs to be changed a week earlier than some other brands. I'm not sure that it's catching more dirt, I think it's just not as sturdy. The corners get a weird crinkle in the edges and the whole filter sort of starts to sink into itself by the fourth week. However,  when these are on sale, they are cheap enough that changing them out a week earlier isn't a big deal.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on November 28, 2015

It won't filter out all of the tiny stuff in the air, but it catches the basic dirt while not introducing a bunch of drag onto your blower.  I considered getting a higher particular cleaning filter but the weight that it could burn out your blower faster just isn't worth it to me.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on October 19, 2015

1113	A Great Help in Reducing Allergies and House Work!	This is my second time ordering the six pack of these filters. They are so dependable, and trap so much dust in my house that I have the need to dust furniture less and less with the continual use of them. I am experiencing far less attacks of allergies now as well, almost never, except when I have windows open.I wasn't sure how much I would like them, since they were a less expensive choice in filters overall on Amazon, but they have exceeded my expectations and so far are my favorite.These filters are a great help in reducing allergies and house work!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 14, 2015

Great for 4ton or less I'd imagine. We will be going with a better higher grade filter in the future as these need to be replaced every 3-4 weeks in our home.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on October 6, 2015

1126	These were recommended by our HVAC technician.	We ordered these because our HVAC technician told us that going with a more "basic" filter was better for our system.  Apparently, the more expensive (thicker) filters clog easily and put way too much pressure on the system.  I ordered them on Friday and had them on Sunday.  The filters are still nicely constructed but they are thinner which should allow more air flow.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 5, 2015

1183	These claim to be suitable for systems with high air ...	These claim to be suitable for systems with high air velocity but this is not true.  These filters are still far too restrictive to use in a high velocity system.  The only filters that seems to work acceptably in a system with high air velocity are the 4" deep Honeywell filters, which have much more filter area and thus, lower air velocity at the media face.  These do require a very deep filter box for proper operation, so they can't be used in all systems.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on August 8, 2015

I love the convenience of having the loose filters laying around.  Now I don't have to open a new filter every few months 'cause they're already unwrapped.

1209	Good serviceable filters	I was told by the repairman who serviced out air conditioning unit not to use super-fine allergy filters unless I had serious allergies, as they filled up faster and blocked more air. These are inexpensive and do the job well; we get great airflow with them and they filter out the dust and cat hair just fine.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 13, 2015
1210	It's worked great so far	HVAC installer told me to replace every month with the cheapest filter I could find.  Odd shape - hard to find.  It's worked great so far.  I can hear a stronger pull on the return though - the other filter (cheap blue one) had no sound and he said that's what you want to prolong the life of the unit.  Anyone else have an opinion?	4.0 out of 5 stars	on July 10, 2015

1213	BASIC is in the description	Emphasis on basic... We don't have any problems other than outside dust so basic is what we need. If you need a filter for anything other than keeping basic dust out of your system spend the extra cash otherwise Filtrete is a quality product.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on July 6, 2015
1214	it makes for a GREAT selling point	I shifted to using the basic dust filter vice a HEPA filter upon the advice of my trusted HVAC technician.HEPAs clog up so fast that they reduce the air flow markedly if not changed out immediately.There's no need for a HEPA filter in a house, it makes for a GREAT selling point, however, and a reason to charge premium prices.HEPAs are used in gas masks in industrial work areas.  My house is not an industrial work area.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 5, 2015
1215	Filtrete 14 x 30 filter - really great!	Great filter at a great price.  They seem to have a nice, fine filter.  When I change them at the end of the season, they have captured some really fine dust particles.  Plus I believe they are doing a really good job because I don't see any particle build up on my outlet vents.  Also, have only found this size at Amazon.  Home Depot and Lowe's sometimes carry it but not worth the search any longer - just get this six-pack from Amazon and you're ready for many seasons.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 2, 2015

1217	Downhill Quality	As stated previously by other reviewers, the quality of these filters has gone downhill. The frame used to be rectangular but they have removed a side so it is very flimsy, especially in the 20x30 size. After using a few of them, I came upon a few that had been slightly bent during shipment...when I installed one, it buckled under the a/c air inflow.  I ended up bracing it with a thin wood slat.  They can hold their own when in undamaged condition, but once they are bent, structural integrity is gone. Gave 2 stars because I don't like they way the quality went down without any warning.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on June 30, 2015

1226	These are cost-efficient filters that have performed exactly as expected	I purchased a set of these filters in the 16x25x1 size for a single-family residence in Florida.  I change the filters regularly every six months, and these clearly filter out a LOT of dust and dirt.  I've used more expensive filters in the past, and I switched to these to save a bit of money.  My power bills have remained low, and I'm happy with the quality of the air in my home.  When I physically examine the filters, I don't see some of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned (in terms of inconsistency of the filtering material).  I'm perfectly happy with these filters, and plan on buying them again when I run out.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 24, 2015

1269	All the Filter You'll Ever Need.	So far so good.  I had been making the mistake of using higher filter ratings (read more filtration).  I am a commercial HVAC guy and I thought a higher filtration would be better, but unless you have a specialized furnace that specifically calls for higher filtration values you will only restrict airflow.  I was getting errors on my furnace and finally realized that I was restricting airflow.These are light yet stiff so they won't fold up on you when you install them.  I also like the fact that they come in a six pack.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on April 14, 2015

I had a hard time fitting this filter in and always had to squeeze it hard to the point where they were always warped when placed. When I measured this particular filter against the others, I found that it was about 1/4 inch bigger than usual.

I'm not sure why, but these are not the same quality I can buy at the local home improvement store for almost the same cost.  The reinforcement on the furnace side is poor, so they sag badly under flow pressure (I have a down flow furnace, but that shouldn't matter).  In addition, once a month replacement during the winter is normal for us (we have lots of critters), but I find every two weeks is the limit on these before the furnace blower begins to strain.For the few cents apiece more they run locally I'm going back to the locally available filters - I wont' be ordering these "sight unseen" again.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on January 16, 2015

These are just right, they filter the dust and are still light enough at allow good air flow.

1365	Excellent anti allergy filter.  Here are some tips	First off, I use this filter covered by a standard cheap fiberglass filter.  Why?  Because any high quality filter has to stop both the large particles and the smaller ones.  Placing the double filter stops the larger particles in the first layer, allowing the second layer to only have to worry about the smaller particles.With this filter, we get much less dust in the house.  It lasts at least three times longer with the cheap "pre-filter" in place, so there is a little money saved there.Basics:Filters are only doing their job if there are no leaks AND you don't allow them to get clogged.  Once you notice the blower is getting louder, it's time to check things out.  I put duct tape around the outside edges of the filter to make sure there are no leaks.  Leaks of course allow dirt to get into the coil fins, and that is an expensive repair, so don't let that happen.  Dirty filters make suction difficult inside the unit, making the motor work harder and not as much air to move through the system, causing less warm or cool air blowing into the rooms of your house... and possible wear and tear on the motor if left fighting the clogged filter for a long time.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 18, 2014

1372	Good Mid-Range Filter at a "Mid-Range" Price	These less-expensive filters (by 3M standards) are of acceptable quality, and may hit the "sweet spot" between price and filtering performance for many users. These do not filter down to the levels that the most expensive 3M filters do (some of these filter particulate matter at such small sizes that they claim to actually reduce odors and filter germs), but they perform reasonably well and are priced reasonably (the finest filters are so expensive that they are almost prohibitive). The quality of them seems reasonably good, although the consistency of the filtering material does not match up to the more expensive filter levels. But if you are looking for a good mid-range filter at a somewhat "mid-range" price, these may fit the bill.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 3, 2014

My main issue arose when I tried to install these filters into the two air returns in my home, it turns out that they are just slightly to large to fit into my 14x30x1 return vents.  I had to bend them slightly then force them into the openings.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on November 23, 2014

1397	High quality filters for home HVAC systems	Love these filters. They definitely catch a LOT of dust and other airborne particles - so much, in fact, that I find I have to replace the filters every couple of months. Not because the filters are inefficient or defective. Quite the contrary. In fact, it is because they are so well made that they are catching so much junk in the air that circulates in my home. I run my a/c and internal air system fairly constantly, as well, adding to the filtering process.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 28, 2014

1400	It's just Ok...	Gets 2 stars...  one for price the other for collecting dust particles.  Durability of these are extremely poor...  not rigid enough to withstand a 3 month duration.  When I replace it, it looks like its going to get sucked up into the system.  Also it makes whistling noises which can be annoying.  I've used Filtrete brand for years and have been extremely happy with there products, but this one just doesn't do it.  I guess you get what you pay for.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on October 25, 2014

1409	Satisfied! Will repurchase these filters again!	We rent our home and are responsible for changing the furnace filters. I went to change this after 1 month and it was barely covered in dirt! I was amazed because we've gone through a lot of other brands of filters over the past 8 months and non have been this top-notch. I think the label says it will clean the air for up to 3 months, but I changed ours after 1 months. I likely could have left it alone for another month, but I'm not sure it would have made it 3 months. Definitely a great value! Will likely purchase again.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 14, 2014

1424	Works okay	Hard to say if they work good, there are so many different kinds of filters you can bye, this one lets a little more dust past than others would recommend if looking for a cheaper filter, going to pay just a little bit more to hopefully have a more well produced filter, would still recommend if you need a filter better to not have a filter	3.0 out of 5 stars	on September 13, 2014
1425	Does what it needs to	Cheap and easy to replace. I had a more restrictive more expensive filter on and it worked well. The main drawback was that a more restrictive filter lowers the efficiency of your home ac unit. It does this by lower the volume of air it can intake and thus lowers the amount it can put out. Remember your vent is not meant to be a whole house air filter (unless specified). You just want something to keep dust out of your ducts and this product does just that. For the price I replace them more regularly about every 3 months. Would definitely recommend.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 13, 2014

1455	Actual Size	This product did not suit my application since my new air handler unit turned out to have a rather smaller (20x24x1) opening.  Visibly this filter did seem to have even coverage of the filtering material and did have wire reinforcement throughout the pleats., however, this does not have the "criss-cross" cardboard reinforcement of other filters on the back side.Note:  Actual size of this filter is 19.7" x 23.7" x 0.8"  or  50.1cm x 60.3cm x 2.0 cm	4.0 out of 5 stars	on July 23, 2014
1456	Does what it's designed to do	So far so good. They do a great job at getting rid of dust in the house. I wish we had a few more intakes around the house to help out more, but from where the air is pulled in, it does a great job.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 22, 2014

1459	Great filter for the house make sure you get the right rating!	Okay so most people think they can buy the most filterable filter and have clean air.

1468	Flimsy and wont fit in my furnace	Due to the poor out case design this filter did not fit in my furnace regardless of it being the same size. It was due to the flimsy outer shell used in making this which made it almost impossible to insert into my furnace. My slot is a bit tight but if the outer shell was a bit more firmer I would not have had any problems. This one I tried to insert and it just kept bending on me. Had to return cause due to it bending and not being firm I could not install it in my furnace.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on June 12, 2014
1469	Great value	I had been buying more expensive filters for our furnace previously, but the company that services our HVAC unit suggested that I go a less expensive route, as we have two cats so are advised to change even a 90 day filter every 30 days. I was also advised that the sturdier the filter, the harder the blower on the unit has to work, so with regard to what we have, changing thinner filters more frequently is more efficient.These were a great buy that I plan to replenish every six months!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 12, 2014
1470	Excellent Product - Great Price	We received the filters noted above.  They were the correct size and with the quantity ordered, the price was excelent.

1472	Fiber Coverage is Inconsistent	The fiber coverage is inconsistently distributed.  Not sure if it will affect performance, but it does seem to indicate a lack of quality control.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on May 29, 2014
1473	Not Like They Used To Be	I have been purchasing these 3M filters in bulk for many years and it's obvious that they have reduced the quality of these.  It was immediately noticeable that the packaging was different when I got my new shipment.  I could also tell that the filters looked thinner (almost see-through) and felt much less sturdy than before.  When installing, the cardboard frame was practically crumbling when trying to press with the tension tabs to hold them in place.  Once the AC came on, you could hear them flexing and crackling under the air pressure.  The sound was loud enough that it woke me up at night when the air came on.  I looked into returning these, but Amazon says it's too late.  I will just throw them away because they are honestly worthless.  Never again!	1.0 out of 5 stars	on May 28, 2014
1474	Easier than going to Home Depot	These are the same as those sold at Home Depot or Lowes.  This is much less expensive than purchasing them individually, plus you don't have to go pick them up.  The pack will last me about a year and a half.  These are very good filters and will last a minimum of three month between changes unless to have a really dusty house.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 24, 2014
1475	works great!	I got these to help filter my office air conditioning system. The system was pretty old and was throwing out black stuff now and then. I decided to get one of these initially to help filter the crap out of the air and to see how bad it was. Within 2 weeks, the entire filter was black! (OMG) That was how much crap it filtered out!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 23, 2014

1479	Just as expected.	Bought these directly from Amazon.com, and they were a much better deal than the local stores here. I actually couldn't even find this size (12x12x1) at Lowe's, they said it was a rare size and didn't have it in their store. Home depot carried this size though.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 15, 2014
1480	Sturdy and good value	I can't find this size anywhere so had to start ordering online. This product does what it is intended to do and the white color looks much better behind the grill than the lower cost 30 day filters I use to buy. More sturdy too for storing them before use.  Will continue to order this product.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 15, 2014
1481	Don't get it!	It larger than listed and does not fit into the duct.  I guess I lost $ on it because I was too busy and did not try it right away while it was still time to return it.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on May 11, 2014
1482	Filtrete website different	So these are cheap and they worked but the description on amazon and on the Filtrete is different.  Filtrete says these do not filter out allergens but here it says they do.  Not sure who is accurate but I bought them for allergies.  I bought a 6 pack but oh well.  Stuck with them.  Next time I will buy the better version since I'm having a allergy attack.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on May 8, 2014
1483	Excellent filter for my air conditioning system.	These filters do an excellent job at holding down dust and whatever else is around.  I was using the high number of microfilter but the a/c tech said I should switch to a lower number so my system does not have to work so hard getting the air through it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 7, 2014

1488	cheaper than Wal-mart	filters way better than standard fiber (glass?) filters. if you spent $10,000 on a high efficiency heat pump like i did, why would you put a $2 filter in it anyway? all that dust that doesn't get filtered plugs up the coils and wrecks your utility bill. these pay for themselves.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 2, 2014
1489	It's an air filter	How can you really review an air filter?  Yes it does the job and catches the dust particles.  Honestly, I was expecting it to be more noticably dirty when I took it out.  Either way, it does the job and seemes to be a decent one.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on April 28, 2014

1491	Decent price filters set	Hard to find this size local, appeared to be fairly priced.  I would purchase again.Many other items appeared overpriced.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on April 27, 2014
1492	Runs Big	My actual a/c opening is 19.25 x 23.25 but most brands of 20x24 filters fit fine. This one was too big. Although I compared it to the one I had removed (also labeled 20x24) it was half an inch longer and slightly wider. Unfortunately they won't work. The filter appears to be a decent quality and has a nice (not super flimsy) feel but for me it was a waste of money.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on April 19, 2014

1495	Heavy duty filter and reasonable price from Amazon	I purchased 2 sizes of this filter and was very pleased.  I priced them at Walmart and the big box stores and Amazon was the most reasonable and a great selection of sizes.  They are supposed to be good for 3 mos. unlike the flimsy cheaper ones.  Very pleased.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 13, 2014
1496	Very Good for the price	The price of furnace filters has gotten to be insane. These filters are reasonable at this price. This is my second pack of these from Amazon, as they always seem to have the best price. My filter box is actually designed for an electronic air cleaner which I need to repair, so I pulled the two electronic boxes out about a year ago, and have not gotten around to replace some of the filament wires. The box had two of those wire filters like you see on a range hood so I used these to support the Filtrete filters by locating them just below the filtrete for support. I run the blower on my furnace full time to cycle the air and these filters do a very respectable job. I'm sure everyone understands that the smaller size the filter is able to catch, the faster your filter is going to need replacement. These filters are a decent compromise. I would like to add here that one of the best things a person can do to enhance the life of their furnace is to keep their blower fan clean. This can usually be accomplished very easily by simply killing the breaker, removing the panel that covers the blower, removing a couple of hex head screws, unplugging the fan and slide it out for cleaning. Most furnace fans are the squirrel cage type and the vanes can really get gummed up which cuts down air flow considerably. I remove mine and put it in my laundry sink with TSP, soap, bleach and hot water. Cleans like new. This is a good time to clean your traps and plenum too. Clogged traps initiate all kinds of furnace problems, and most HVAC people never do the kind of job you would, they simply cannot spend the time. (And...........They want to sell you a new furnace) LOL	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 11, 2014
1497	Perfect for the price!	I've used more expensive filters but I notice no difference in dust with these cheaper ones. It's great to extras on hand to change the filter monthly.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 28, 2014
1498	Good Furnace Filters	The filters shipped fast, and seem to be of good quality. They were also at a decent price. If they keep doing a good job, I will definitely buy more in the future! Thanks	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 19, 2014
1499	Good Pricing	I have been pricing these for some time and noticed that the pricing for these have really gone up even at the discount stores. In my area....no matter what; the filter has to be changed every 30 days. So this purchase was best for me. 3-M has always been a good product and these installed right in with no trouble.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 14, 2014
1500	No regrets	After using the high-end allergy filters for years (to the the tune of $15-$20 each), I finally came around to how ridiculous that was. They were too restrictive, contributing to problems with both of my HVAC units. (Trust me, let your units breathe and do your real filtration with a couple of HEPA units elsewhere in the house!) I still can't stand using the ultra-cheapo kind, though, as they just can't stop enough dust/debris from getting in the system. These filters seem to be a great compromise, providing decent filtration without restricting flow too much or breaking the bank. At this price, I can afford to change them more often!Just make sure they seat well and don't allow "blow-by."	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 12, 2014
1501	Filters... ?	Well, for me - this is the Cadillac of Filters.Usually, I go for a 50 cent filter when they are out of the 49 cent filters.This critter is up in the 5 to 6 dollar range.but,It is a noticeably better filter.Structurally and in the filtering material itself, it is a pretty good filter.I have yet to notice any improvement in the dust levels in the house.But,My system is in need of comprehensive maintenance.There is only so much slack that a filter is going to take up.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on March 10, 2014
1502	They Get Filthy...	I was astonished the first time I changed our furnace filter in our new house. It was three months old and FILTHY!But a filthy filter is a good filter. And I might start changing it more frequently to help it do it's job better.This is a good filter.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 8, 2014
1503	Does the job, great price	I measured & looked at old filer before I ordered, so of course they fit. They are meeting my expectations in collecting the dust that circulates throughout. I bring my dogs in, so keeping up with dust & dander is important of me. Visitors cannot even tell our dogs hang out in the house. These filters were also a great price from the supplier. There are a lot of filter options out there & the price of these for the quality was very good.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 5, 2014
1504	Inexpensive filters	They work fine.  I change my filters once a month and I do not suffer from allergies, so I don't have to buy the special ones.  These work fine.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 2, 2014
1505	Great place to buy odd size filters	One of the reasons I bought these through Amazon was getting odd size filters - I could drive around forever trying to find the right size but why should I waste time when I can order on line and have them shipped (free with prime)	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 27, 2014
1506	Good	I haven't had it long enough to really say I love it or hate it. So far its working good.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 26, 2014
1507	poorly made	These are not the quality filters that I am used to receiving from Filtrete. As soon as the fan come on, the filter came loose from the cardboard frame and a three inch gap appeared on one side. Just like having no filter at all. Put in another and it did the same in about a week. Would not recommend anyone waste their money and time on these.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on February 24, 2014
1508	High Quality Filter	keeps my home from accumulating dust particles. just make sure you change it out every 3 months. I really searched far and wide for this size and none of the big box stored carried this size. Luckily Amazon exist!!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 19, 2014
1509	Filters at 1/2 Walmart prices	These filters are good dust filters and are cheaper than the ones you find at Walmat. I'll order the replacement filters again.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 18, 2014
1510	Perfect fit!	I have a hard time finding quality air filters in my size.  These came in a box so no worries about dents, etc... and work perfectly in my system.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 18, 2014
1511	Great Find!!!	Filters are something I seem to never remember to purchase.  When I need one I have to make a trip to get one to replace the nasty one.  Now I have a box of them waiting to be used.  It was so easy to order them and have them delivered to my door.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 17, 2014
1512	So convenient to have on hand!	When my  furnace man was here anyway, it was really convenient to have had this available as my furnace is in a crawl space to which I have never been in and do not intend to observe by going down a five foot ladder!So I ordered the 6 pak via PRIME!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 15, 2014
1513	Get the job done	Can't beat the price for the number of filters you get and gets the job done for standard furnace/ HVAC units.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 10, 2014
1514	Working well	I had heard and read that pleated filters make the compressor work too hard to circulate air, thus being bad for an HVAC unit. However, I later read that the only pleated filters that do this are the 3M filters, so I have been using this brand instead, so far with excellent results. The loosely woven fiber filters are a waste of money.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 8, 2014
1515	Clean air is always nice	We need to change our filters every few months. Or rather we should change them every few months. But who remembers to look up? Never mind get to the store to get the filter. Then you get there and can't remember what size we need. Order from home so you can confirm he size before placing the order. Order a set so you have extras on hand. Now just remember to look up.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 8, 2014
1516	Box arrived damaged bent	The filters were not even in a shipping box it was two boxes taped together end to end I am extremely disappointed in the packaging.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on February 7, 2014
1517	Works for me	The "Filtrete Clean Living Filter, 16-Inch by 25-Inch by 1-Inch, 6-Pack" works for me and my household of 4 people.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 6, 2014
1518	Fantastic price	Best way to purchase filters.  Carries us through 6 months, and don't have to constantly hunt for a filter to fit the unit.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 6, 2014
1519	For the price... NO	Ok, so... I live in the country at the end of a dirt road and it gets dusty in my home. I used to buy the 1.00 filter from the feed store for my house and replace it every 30 days like clockwork. I decided I would try these to see if there was any kind of improvement in performance of anything. Quite frankly... since I've bought these and have been using them I have been finding myself dust my home 3X per week now as opposed to once. These are significantly more expensive than the generic version for 1.00 at the feed store but are very POOR. I have never had a dustier, dirtier home. I will most definitely NEVER use these again. Horrible.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on February 6, 2014
1520	Great Product	Very glad to find them.  I have trouble finding them in the store.  We have them for six months and at a much better price than what I pay for when I can find them in the store.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 4, 2014
1521	Benefit of ordering in bulk	I'm terrible at remembering to change the filter in my furnace. By the time I remember that the filter needs to be changed and then make it to a hardware store, it's been months! With this package of six, my chances are least better of changing the filter in a timely fashion. These filters aren't as thick/dense as other filters I've tried. Since I change them more regularly, though, these are probably better for my furnace, and a better value.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 4, 2014
1522	Great outlet for not commonly found filter size.	Our builder installed the 18 X 18 X 1 filter and we have not been able to find it in nearby stores.  It is great to have this multi-pack available on Amazon for the recommended filter changes.  It works well and has been a stable in our home for two years.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 3, 2014
1523	Good Price Good Qualilty	I replace my furnace filter every 90 days so I purchase the six-pack.  This filter works great and you can easily see all of the dirt, lint and other foreign airborne mites. Best price I have found for this product.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 1, 2014
1524	Excellent filter	As far as AC filters go I am pretty sure they are standard. They all fit the way they are supposed to and they all have directional arrows to show which way to put it.To get the 14x30 for $30.74 and the 20x24 for $34.17 both seemed like great prices. Coming in a 6 pack was great too because I only need to order them once a year.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 29, 2014
1525	Great buy, does the trick	You get what you pay for. These are decent filters that certainly collect a lot in a 3-month period - my visual assessment of satisfaction is how dirty they get (I have a pet-free, smoke-free home, but i still expect them to 'cleanse' the air of dust, etc.)You can spend more, but why?	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 28, 2014
1526	These filters work great but look super dirty after 2 weeks	got these for the old house and they worked great. I do not have any allergies so I cannot comment on the filtration efficiency.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 26, 2014
1527	Collapses inside my furnace	The 20x24 filter is poorly constructed and collapses inside my furnace after a few weeks.  I've never had this problem with other filters, including other Filtretes.  When you pick up the filter it become obvious that corners were cut in it's design as it's somewhat flimsy.Not recommended.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on January 26, 2014
1528	Excellent Filter	The 300 MPR is excellent because it does not strain my AC/Heating unit.  Have been changing this filter every 30 days. Fast shipping. Arrived in original 3M box with the 6 filters individually wrapped inside.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 23, 2014

1532	This product has changed...for the worse.	I have been buying the Filtrete 300 for more than 2 years. It is the "lower end" in the Filtrete line, but I always viewed it as a step above the cheaper fiber filters. It got the job done, and I was happy with it. Recently I bought a new pack of these and went to replace my old Filtrete 300 filter (the exact same model, only older). To my dismay, I noticed that the new filter had several thin spots in it, not unlike the less expensive fiber filters I prefer not to use. I bought the six pack, so I thought this could be a fluke and pulled out another - same thing. At this point I pulled out my old one for comparison. Well, not only was the newer one noticeably thinner, there were 3 fewer pleats in the filter. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that fewer pleats means less material (and thinner material at that). It is kind of like that "2 oz." candy package that suddenly became 1.74 oz. but costs the same - bad move 3M! I used to love these filters, but now they are no better than the cheap fiber ones. I will not buy them again.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on January 11, 2014
1533	Great investment	The product is a great investment to homeowners.  It make more sense to buy in bulk as opposed to buying individually.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 11, 2014

1536	Good filters	Glad I got these on Amazon. The filters for my HVAC are very difficult to find and expensive when I do find them. This 6 pack of filters should last a while and it only costs about $5 per filter. Now, if I only remember to change them out when I am supposed to...	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 7, 2014
1537	Stupid me!	I ordered the wrong size.  Had it been right I would have loved it.  We really like the Filtrete brand.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on January 5, 2014
1538	Great price for 6	These are very thin compared to past filters I've bought, but I think it's a good deal for 6 of them. I usually buy the filters that last 3 months and they never make it past 2 in my house, so I figured I would give these a chance.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on January 5, 2014
1539	High potential for being ripped off with this one	Says six, received five. The filters come in their own box, in my case within a larger shipment, and despite being sold and shipped by Amazon directly, when I received mine the box had already been opened and one of the filters removed.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on January 4, 2014
1540	Clean air	The size we needed wasn't in stores so I decided to pull up Amazon. Sizing was available and with prime shipping we had it in a couple days. Product arrived as described, easy to remove from packaging and install. Def worth it as previously we spent over an hour + going to Home Depot and Lowes to not have the selection available.If you have a non-standard size I recommend searching online first to save trips to the store.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 3, 2014
1541	All Filtrete products are great	I picked this because I have a huge dust issue I have to resolve.  This works great.  I trust the brand and it never lets me down.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 2, 2014
1542	Just what we needed	Not much to say about these filters.  This particular size is difficult to find in stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It fit perfectly, which was the #1 concern.  I've always had good luck with Filtrete brand items, so I have no concerns with the quality.  The product arrived on time and was package securely, which is important so that the filters are not bent/damaged prior to installation.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 1, 2014
1543	Thank goodness for Amazon!	Our furnace requires an odd size filter which is difficult to find at local hardware stores.  Then, when you DO find the correct size, it's the higher-rated, more expensive version which you can see by other comments here, can actually HARM your HVAC unit.  I will always turn to Amazon for stocking up on supplies easily with free shipping via A-Prime.  Want to agree with one person's comment that the delivery box makes a nifty "dispenser" and keeps the filters safe from my kitty-cats when they have play-time in the garage. Very thoughtful design . ..	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 1, 2014
1544	Good product, we have a hard-to-find size, very good price on Amazon	Good product, we have a hard-to-find size (24" x 24"), very good price on Amazon.  Much easier than trying to drive over town to find it and this 300MPR is a good balance between cost and filtration.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 31, 2013
1545	Nice product except for one thing.	Nothing wrong with the product except most nominal 24x24 filters usually are 23 3/8 x 23 3/8.If you look at online vendorsyou will notice this. My return air filter grille is sized for the smaller size and the old filter that came out was the smallersize. This would normally not be a problem,except for some reason the 24 x 24 sized filter are supplied in both sizes,unlikealmost all other size filters.With a little forcing mine works but next time I order it will be for the smaller size. Price is right andshipping right on time.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 30, 2013

1554	Works Great	this filter does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a good value. The slot my filter goes into is a bit tighter than it should be and the last set of filters used to have cardboard strapping that would get stuck on the duct work. This doesn't have that and it fits perfectly - even though it is the same size as my old filters.Remember this comes in a pack of 6 as well	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 19, 2013

1556	Does the job for a good price....	I think this works as well as any other filter I've had. I have a cat with asthma so I need to change the filters once a month. These are affordable and seem to work just fine. They were delivered very quickly.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 7, 2013

1564	Great filters that really help reduce the dust -	These are very nice filters. We always use 2 filters but with these you only need to use one. We have some of the older ones that you can see through so we put both this one and the other one until we use up the old ones. Hope all that makes sense LOL. Anyway, this filter is a little more pricey but they last longer. We try to change our filters every month but sometimes it's 3 months. Time flies! You totally can't get away from dust but now that I think about it, it does seem like our dust is lighter! Mmmm! Pretty good. I didn't realize it until now, doing this review, that that was the reason. I highly recommend these filters.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on November 16, 2013

1572	Doing Great	I have for years been buying cheap filters at the bog box stores and I nerve felt I was getting the best of filtering. I then opted for one of those high cost permanent ones and don't know if I was doing any better. This time I purchased these filters to see if I could get greater dust removal in the air and I think I have succeeded. The filters are doing a great job. One small issue. The frames on these filters are no better than the cheap framed ones and I continually find corners collapsing when I insert a new one.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 30, 2013

1575	Good way to get your filters	I live in a small town.  Every three months I have to find replacement filters.  I never can find them.  It usually takes a few trips to Walmart and the local grocery and hardware stores.  But now, I can buy them from Amazon.  And because I'm a "Prime" member, I don't pay shipping.  So the cost is within pennies of what I would pay in town.  Well worth it!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 26, 2013

Im happy with the filters especially since a 20 x 24 is an oddball size I could only find locally in that blue, ineffecient fiberglass.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on September 26, 2013
1586	Worked as expected.	These are your basic filters. There isn't too much to say other than they fit as stated on the box.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 23, 2013
1587	OK	The quality is a little less then what I was buying from Home depot.  But much cheaper.  I will swap them out more often.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on September 22, 2013
1588	great product	these were almost as cheap as WM and with free shipping. The nice thing is not having to go to the store and hunt only to find they are sold out. This is a popular size.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 18, 2013
1589	It works	This does what it's supposed to do and seems much higher quality than previous filters I've used. It seems to allow better airflow and doesn't get sucked-up into the duct like my old filters did.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 18, 2013
1590	big box. does the job. delivered right to my door.	not much to say about these. definately a more boring item to purchase on amazon. i didnt get all excited like i normally do about packages. just filters. necessary but boring.they work. :) good price.hope this helps:)	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 17, 2013
1591	Great filter	This is a great filter for my furnace and the 6 pack makes it very affordable. While the initial price seems steep, to buy 6 of these individually, I'd pay almost twice as much. Plus having 6 gets me through the winter without having to worry about not having a replacement filter every month.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 16, 2013
1592	Filters!	These are filters for my ac vent systems. Seems to be exactly what they promised. No excess packaging.  Good job.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 13, 2013
1593	Product does the job	I use to buy a filter only when I needed one at any local store but I figured heck why not save money by buying in bulk and buying less expensive ones. I usually get the filters that say they block out more things but thought I'd give these a try.  So far they have been doing great and I don't feel like they are filtering the air any less than the more expensive ones. Overall satisfied with the product and will continue to buy.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on September 9, 2013
1594	Great price	Much more economical to buy in the 5-pack than singly at the hardware store.  We don't have allergy issues, so these do the trick to keep dust out of the furnace.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 2, 2013
1595	the right size and perfect value.	Hard to find this size...near impossible to find locally.  Works  great,  also purchased the 600mpr in 14x25  and i am not sure the mpr makes a difference in actual use...I'm sure someone will believe otherwise, but i am happy with this 300mpr quality.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 1, 2013
1596	WORKS GREAT WITH MY A/C.	all products good except iron head covers. to hard to put on clubs.  been usung this brand for many years.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 1, 2013
1597	Seems a good value	The filters were bought for our dehumidifier in our crawl space.The one that came with the unit lasted a year.I installed a Filtrete filter last April and have not been in the craw space since.So, I really cannot judge how well this product is doing.I liked the fact that I could find the correct size and there were 6 filters in the box.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on August 31, 2013
1598	Does the job	How excited can I be about a filter?  I don't know.  It does the job, catches a lot.  Needs to be changed once a month, but that's good because it isn't letting anything through. Glad I'm not breathing all that stuff.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on August 29, 2013
1599	Looks like a good value	Rec'd product on time . Excellent packaging by 3m .allowing for good storage of the extra filters  Filters fit perfectly and are quite rigid.Overall easier purchase thru Amazon and no searching for correct size.I cannot vouch at this time for efficiency of filters but based on my  initial findings I think the filter will be fine.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 28, 2013
1600	Decent Filter	I love the Filtete filters but normally by the more expensive ones.  Figured I would give this a try.  So far so good.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on August 23, 2013
1601	These filters are perfect and reasonably priced!	We were in need of furnace filters and when our new house was inspected, the fellow said we do not have to use those high number filters on our Lennox furnace.  I had always used the premium ones at our previous house.These work great and still last 90 days.  I bought six and know that we are set for some time.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 19, 2013
1602	FILTRETE DUST REDUCTION FILTER	Having a long-hair black cat, I was amazed at the cat hair in the filter.  I am a Filtrete user!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 17, 2013
1603	My A/C cools like a new unit!	I just got these in time for the dog days of summer, and, you will not believe the difference it makes in cooling! I have lived here 8 years and my unit has never cooled like this. (yes, I buy my own filters because the ones provided by the complex are #{[\*^).	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 17, 2013
1604	Great filters, good selection and availability of sizes.	I buy these on here on Amazon because I have an oddball size. 14x30. I can't get these locally, Have been using these filters for over a year. No issues and the price can't be beat. They catch cat hair and plenty of dust. Will continue to keep buying.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 16, 2013
1605	Good Product Poor Shipping	The product works well enough but it arrived in a box that was badly bent so the filters could not be used.  Returned package to merchant and went to Home Depot!  Much easier!	1.0 out of 5 stars	on August 15, 2013
1606	Good filters	These filters perform well and make it close to the 3 month usage period, in my home. They come with replacement/reminder stickers and can be stored in the box that they're shipped in.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 15, 2013
1607	Great value	Ordering these filters in the package of six just makes sense.  When it is time to change the filter you always have one on hand.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 15, 2013
1608	Five Stars	They fit perfect and filter great!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 13, 2013
1609	better than standard ones	These really are better than standard ones. My a/c was installed in the 80s, is my guess. Knock on wood, it seems to be holding up and doing well. The local home stores (we have TWO Lowes and TWO Home Depots don't carry my size any more, and ordering from them seems like a middle man approach. I will order these online from now on, and in bulk for a better deal.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 12, 2013
1610	A/C filter	This was order for my central ac duct. The other stores in my area way to expensive for the same item. This product works great.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 10, 2013
1611	good product	came as promised, met my expectation, great product, good price comparing to Walmart, or home depot. I highly recommended it.In fact I ordered that for my brother and I'll order it for my self next time.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 9, 2013
1612	They are filters...	They fit in the air filter slot and then filtered air.  Not really anything special, seem to work well, 5 stars.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 9, 2013
1613	Good product at a great price	I used to buy these filters from my local Wal-Mart until they stopped carrying them.  Fortunately, I found these online at Amazon and had them delivered to my front door for just a few cents more per filter than the old Walmart price.  I received them within three days of purchase even though I chose the money saver shipping option.  Just hope Amazon still carries them in a few months when I need to purchase more.  Neither Lowes nor Home Depot carry this size in stock.  The last time I ordered a set of filters from Home Depot it took two weeks to receive and I was not satisfied with the filter quality.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 3, 2013
1614	Works for me.	Really does the job. I live in a dusty state and even I was surprised at how often I need to change filters. The filters are easy to install and keep my house less dusty.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 28, 2013
1615	Can't beat the price...	Delivered on time, exactly as ordered.This is the right filter for our furnace and now we have plenty to last the season.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 27, 2013
1616	Kind of flimsy	I guess you get what you pay for.  These filters almost get sucked down the air exchange because they are flimsy.  I put some duck tape across the middle to help the structure.  Fingers crossed.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on July 14, 2013
1617	300 MPR filter	Received filters today.  Prompt shipping, as described.  Looks like quality filter, have just installed so I can verify performance.  What else can I say, "It's an air condition filter?"	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 11, 2013
1618	in furnace	as we speak. I use them when I use the heat in the winter and in summer when I use the air conditioning. Delivered in a timely fashion this past winter. They are by 3 M a company who is #1 in my book! I have tried other filters by other companies and these are the best I have used!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 23, 2013
1619	Works well...	I had tried a much more expensive filter, and it seemed to make my A/C work really hard trying to push the air through. This type was recommended to me, and has worked well filtering out the dust, and my A/C is quiet again.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on June 22, 2013
1620	Good stuff	Great price. You can always count on 3M quality. Bought the case, each filter is seperately wrapped. Quick shipping, will buy again.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 17, 2013
1621	Great quality! No more sneezing!	Nice to have a supply on hand so we can change our furnace /AC every month, on time, without a trip to the store. Keeps up with it improves my dust allergies immensely.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 13, 2013
1622	Excellent Value!	Recently, when I noticed that it was getting uncomfortably warm in the house, I notified my husband.  It turns out that the AC line was freezing up.  He changed the batteries in the thermostat, and the following Sunday morning went to Home Depot to purchase two filters for about $10 each.  Problem solved.  With only the price of the house call, we had our Heating and Air fellow come out on Monday to check our AC and it was fine, no freon needed.  It's almost too cold now, so I've moved the thermostat up.  Now that I know where the filter goes in the furnace (the filter door), I have assumed responsibility and control of the AC.  I have researched and reviewed all the information I could find and I believe this particular filter suits our needs perfectly.  I must also mention that I read a tip from another reviewer who mentioned that he picked up the tip of spraying the filter with PAM before installing and that increased the amount of dust collected.  I will try it in a couple of months.The six-pack of filters was delivered in two days enclosed in a hard cardboard box with perforations for opening and removing an unbent filter as needed.  This is the BEST VALUE hands down!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 6, 2013
1623	Great set of filters	I was a little skeptical buying air conditioning filters from Amazon, wondering if they would arrive damaged or not.  They arrived in a  heavy box with no damage.  These are a great price.  I change my filter monthly because I have 2 dogs and a cat in the house.  My nephew, an AC certified technician, installed a high efficiency heat pump in my house a little over a year ago.  He told me to only get filters in the 300-400 range.  That the heavier filters with high MPR ratings are as bad as a dirty filter when it comes to air flow.  And even though the picture of this filter shows vertical pleats they are the regular horizontal pleated filters.I am so glad I found these.  Much cheaper than even Walmart (only place to shop where I live and they never have my size).	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 31, 2013
1624	Exactly what I needed	My headline says it all. I hate going to the store and never being able to find the correct size. This way I have a 6 pack and I'm good to go for a while!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 22, 2013
1625	Five Stars	Great package of these filters. Pack of six. Great price!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 10, 2013
1626	Better Price but....	The price is nice but my ac guy says not to wait 3 month to change them out.  They are not the card board type filters.  Very flimsy.  I am not very versed on filters, so I may have picked the wrong one.	3.0 out of 5 stars	on May 9, 2013
1627	Excellent product	This is an excellent filter. It works well. The efficiency of the collection of particulate matter is excellent for my system.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 8, 2013
1628	It's a filter, it filters stuff	Not much to say. I bought the six pack as we've a lot of pollen in our area and I prefer to change filters every few months. These appear to work just fine. Fit and finish for a throwaway product is good, and the box design acts as a dispenser. What more can one say about a filter?	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 6, 2013
1629	Keeps out dust etc...	These filters are great and it is handy to order online since my filter size is not one of the more common ones.  I change them about every 2 months when I am running my unit regularly.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 6, 2013
1630	Perfect Fit.	This is a very hard to find size.  When I'm lucky to find it, most of the times it does not fit correctly.  These fit perfectly.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 4, 2013
1631	Change that filter soon	I ordered this product for a family member because I had a difficult time finding this particular size.  I got it quickly and my family member is very happy because it was a great price and was a bulk package so she will not need another filter as often.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 20, 2013
1632	Way cheaper than in the store	these things are way cheaper than buying them in any store and they are exactly as advertised. i will be buying these again they save money and i can change them more often if i want.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 20, 2013
1633	Apparently a Weird Size	I was so glad to find these 20" x 24" filters on Amazon because none of our local stores had them and we were ending up having to cut filters to make them fit so I am happy with this purchase - no more cutting!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 12, 2013
1634	Very thin/bare	I have bought Filtrete filters before and they have been a solid white accordian shape which makes it easy to tell when they are getting dirty and need to be replaced.  This is the first time I have bought these via the internet and when they came in, they looked dingy and threadbare.  Everytime I walk by my air intake, this threadbare quality makes it look like the filter is dirty and needs to be changed.  This also makes me wonder if it is doing it's job of trapping the dust or letting things slip buy.  Since I have trouble finding this size at my local stores, needless to say, I will be looking elsewhere online for replacements.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on April 11, 2013
1635	They are filters	They are filters that fit into a furnace and in three months they are covered in crap and have to be replaced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 10, 2013
1636	Good Value - nice to buy in bulk	It is a good value compared to buying at Lowes. Nice to buy in bulk and change out filter regularly.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 8, 2013
1637	Works very well	It was having a difficult time finding these filters locally, mainly due to their size. Buying them in quantity helped save a little money and they arrived within a week.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 6, 2013
1638	Do You Want a Cleaner Home?	I have been using these Filtrete filters for some time and eventually got the bright idea of trying to order them online rather than buying them individually at a hardware store.  I'm now saving money!  My house and ductwork definitely stay much cleaner with these filters compared to using the inexpensive 30-day blue fiberglass filters.  However, I find that the filter is ready to be changed after 60 days as opposed to the claim that they can last up to 90 days.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 6, 2013
1639	excellent deal	I bought this pack instead of buying the filters one at a time to save money.  It is a great deal and they work well	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 5, 2013
1640	Great filter	Fits perfectly and I like that each filter is individually wrapped so they won't gather dust while in storage.  Will purchase again	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 1, 2013
1641	Filtrete Furnace Filters	Other filters I had, with same rating, were clogging prematurely. I now think problem may have been the ultrasonic humidifier.  These filters were priced right and although with a same dirt filter rating, they have the more traditional medium and did not clog from the fine mist the ultrasonic humidifier puts into the air.  I am quite satisfied with them; although the ultrasonic humidifier not so much.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on March 28, 2013
1642	Great Filter	We change our air filter monthly (as recommended when purchased a new AC unit last year) and this is a great filter.  It sure is nice to purchase them in bulk too!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 14, 2013
1643	great deal, shipped fast	They are slightly cheaper than in home depot/Lowes... buy in bulk and you never forget to replace them. The filter system works great!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 8, 2013
1644	Hard to find filters	Great filter at a great price.  These are not a normally stocked it item at your local hardware (big box) store.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 5, 2013
1645	Great value and performance!!	You can't beat the price of these 3m filters. They perform as good as filters costing twice as much. I would say they have the ability to stay in your furnace for the time printed on the packaging which is 3 months.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 28, 2013
1646	Works!	These filters work well, using 30 days of fan runtime means I go through about 6 a year. Very cost effective compared to some of the other filter levels offered.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 28, 2013
1647	Yeah boy	great price, and exactly as described.  thank you.  I buy for business usage, and this is the best way to get what i need.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 26, 2013
1648	Quality has slipped dramatically	I have used these for several years now with good results, but this latest batch is of the absolute poorest quality. Practically transparent filter material. Don't know if this is a bad lot as the other sizes don't seem to be as bad, but these 12 x 12 ones are unacceptable quality. If by intent, then shame on 3M.  If by accident, they need better QC. Not buying these again. Will have to go higher up in cost and quality.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on February 24, 2013
1649	Works	This is a quality product. I have used 3M filters for years and they are very consistent and do the job.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 20, 2013
1650	Perfect balance of fitration and performance	Forget what you have been told about furnace filters.  Furnace filters are used to clean air entering the blower unit of your HVAC.  Excessive constriction of the air to your HVAC will reduce blower efficiency and life.  "High-performance" heavily constrict airflow.Filters beyond 600 MPR or MERV 10 are seeking air purification, not HVAC filtration.  Users seeking "cleaner air" should buy dedicated HEPA air purifiers	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 15, 2013
1651	Good Value, Last a While	I wish I didn't have to buy six of these at a time, seeing as they lest for a few months a piece, but oh well. Apparently this is an odd size, and they didn't have any at any of the stores I went to.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on February 11, 2013
1652	great	Works great, and a good price. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I will definitely use this product again	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 9, 2013
1653	Filtrete Dust Reduction Filters are great!	I have two units to purchase for and these have worked out just fine.  They do trap the dust and work great.  I will purchase them again.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 8, 2013
1654	Works great	Got a whole box for my furnace. Air quality is great and it really gets filled up with dust (due to crawlspace).	5.0 out of 5 stars	on February 7, 2013
1655	Dust Blower	Never get a filter with this low of a MPR.  It stated dust reduction, but is more of a dust blower.  Filtrete makes good filter but purchase higher MPR or MERV rated filters.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on February 6, 2013
1656	Replacement Filters	These are really great filters.  Being smokers and having a pet, we want to keep the dust as clean as possible in our home.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 31, 2013
1657	great filter	does the job.. and did my research.. beware of too fine a filter as it takes more energy to suck.. this one is perfect	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 26, 2013
1658	Nice filters.	I put these in the office. We had some really cheap filters that needed replaced. These work well and are much better than the previous ones !!!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 25, 2013
1659	Nice and inexpensive.	I like to replace my furnace filter three times per year. I've found that, unless there is a smoker or animals in your home, or you live in an area with notable air pollution levels,  you don't need to spend extra money on fancy-schmancy filters. These are a step up in quality from crappy fiberglass filters, and the price point, along with free shipping, is an added bonus.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 23, 2013
1660	good product and good price	Been using this since about a year, best price that I could find. Hopefully they do not discontinue this product.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 21, 2013
1661	Great Filter at a Great Price	Was looking for something just in this price range. Got the order in great packaging in a timely manner. Removed the packaging and put them in. Great fit with no issues. I'll be ordering more when these are gone.To the person who criticized the frame.... it's just an A/C filter. You put it in and close it up. Are you playing Frisbee with it or what? How strong does it have to be?I think some people will find ANYTHING to complain about; just to complain.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 14, 2013
1662	Quick ship	Item as described and arrived quickly.  No damage/dents to package.  So much easier than running out to Home Depot or Lowe's!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 10, 2013
1663	hard to rate	well, they fit fine:)but cannot tell if they actually are doing anything (dust reduction wise) now, when they are due for a rinse guess I might be able to tell then	3.0 out of 5 stars	on January 9, 2013
1664	Good Value	After pricing these same filter at two hardware stores plus three other stores decided this was the way to go. Bought one local to try at $12.54 and noticed reduced dust on the glass  TV stand and after two months use (rated for three) still little dust and holding the filter up to the sun very little dust in the filter. Fourth month is over doing it for us but three months works great. $75.24 local $32-33 at Amazon Great Deal.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 6, 2013
1665	Filtrete Dust Reduction Filter, 300 MPR, 20-Inch by 30-Inch by 1-Inch...	Size is perfect for our return air outlet. These are a little flimsy, but I wanted something that wasn't so fine that would restrict air flow and these were perfect.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 3, 2013
1666	Gets the job done	It gets the job done!  Very good and inexpensive to purchase.  We have enjoyed them and will recommend them to anyone	5.0 out of 5 stars	on January 3, 2013
1667	Need filter to control pollution	Bought these filters for the AC unit in our house. Pollution here in China is very bad and we are testing to see if these filters will work. The ones used in the house are man made with metal frame, we have to clean them at least once a month.Now the house smells better and the air is cleaner in our home. Will recommend anyone with pollution problems to purchase this product. After installing the filters we are breathing better air.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on January 2, 2013
1668	Good	GoodThat is all I have to say.That is all I have to sayThat is all I have to say	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 29, 2012
1669	Good value	Makes regular changing of furnace filter easy because I now have a supply of it lying around instead of the old days when I would run out to Home Depot to get a filter. Good value. i would order again.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 24, 2012
1670	Quck and fast service	Used prime. Received in 2 days. Good packaging. Fair price. Fits the furnace wellDidn't want to spend fortune on filters. This serves everyday needs well	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 21, 2012
1671	Seem to work as well as the red versions from the big box stores	I got tired of overpaying at the big box retailers so I bought a case of these. They work great. I can't tell a difference between these and the red or blue packaged Filtrete ones I bought at HD or L. I run mine for 30 days and they are pretty dirty, so it looks like they are working.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 19, 2012
1672	Great value,  3M quality	Bought this 6 pack so i will always have them handy when its time to change the filter. Since we have dogs in the house I like to change these a lot faster than usual.  I notice a TON of dust in the house so a good filter is definitely required.  I changed it aroudn 3 months and the filter was a little dark but its good to know the filter is clean again and I am not breaking the bank.Dunno how to really test the quality of air or not but I bought them for a brand name as well as a great price.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 12, 2012
1673	Anti Dust	Great Value on these! They work well. Just slide out the old filter and slide in the new one. Packaged securely!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on December 11, 2012
1674	Works Well	Product works well at what it is supposed to do, however, dimensions were slightly too large so I had trouble placing this filter in. Filter does fit with no gaps around sides, but did take more pushing and twisting to replace this filter than last one used.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 7, 2012
1675	love these filters	These are my favorite kind of filters.  I like the quilted accordion design and after doing a lot of research, I think these are a good compromise between the cheap filters that don't work very well or catch much dirt/particles and the more expensive filters that can reduce airflow too much and be hard on the furnace.  I usually change mine after a month or two, depending on how they look, but at this price, that's not a difficult thing to do.  I love that these come in a 6 pack and I can get free two-day shipping (Prime membership).  My local stores never seem to have this size in stock.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on November 29, 2012
1676	Good value.	Surprised how fast I've needed to go through these. With 2 cats, a dog and a busy house, I change these every month. Great price and they work well.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on November 27, 2012
1677	Don't Buy The 6 Pack- I got ripped off	I ordered the six pack of filters and paid for the six pack price. I received a SINGLE filter. I contacted customer service and they said they would fix my order and send me a six pack of filters the next day. When I received the "fixed" order.......It Was A Single Filter again. So I emailed Amazon and never got a response. I paid over $30 for two filters. Awesome. I will never order a six pack of filters again.	1.0 out of 5 stars	on November 21, 2012

1680	Great Filter!	Great filters for reducing dust and pollen! I don't particularly like the high MPR filters, as they restrict air flow, however, that's a personal preference.These filters are way better than the cheap ones my parents have been using.  Just what they needed!	4.0 out of 5 stars	on October 12, 2012
1681	expensive but effective	I never believe the time frame on any filter since I run the fan about 24 hours a day during the summer.  I was happy to get 3-4 weeks out of each filter and they are very effective.  All of these filters seem so expensive but I was happy with the filters and the quick service.  I also can't find the 12X20X1 at home depot anymore.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on October 9, 2012
1682	whole house air filters	what can i say. they are air filters. they clean air going into my furnance. they work well. I would reccomend them to all and this price they are a good deal.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 20, 2012
1683	AC filter replacement	Since I can never find a 32"x25" filter to fit my AC I always shop for 2 16"X 25" and tape them together.  I like the Filtrete brand and this six-pack was an excellent price.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 9, 2012
1684	Great Filter at a Great Price	Originally, we bought these from our local grocery store but had to stop because they charged exhorbitant prices for only a 4-pack. Amazon rocks, as usual, by selling a 6-pack at a fair price that actually makes sense per the filters' contruction. These are excellent air filters, above & beyond the non-pleated variety. There is apparently another style a step beyond these that supposedly do an even better job of trapping allergens, but we find these to be more than adequate at cleaning air. At each changing, the white has visibly darkened & we can see any gnats, hairs & particles each filter has magically filtered out of our air. We change them monthly, however, not quarterly as they're sometimes marketed. Actually, most AC technicians will tell you it's better to change your filter every month, especially if you use the cheap, non-pleated kind, & even more if you smoke, burn candles, have pet dander or allergies. Even with this more expensive, pleated filter, it's still smart to change it about every 30 days. Mark it on your calendar or in your smart phone to look at it at least once a month. At this price & by the 6-pack, these hard workers are affordable. We love them & highly recommend them. Whether you rent or own where you live, you can take control of your personal space, the air you breath. These filters will cleanse your air, make your air conditioner run more efficiently, thereby slightly reducing the electricity bill perhaps at least enough to pay for filters, & maybe even help the unit last longer, all of which are always good things.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 20, 2012
1685	Works great	Bought these online because Home Depot, OSH, and Lowe's don't carry this non-standard size.  Saved money and item was shipped quickly.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 20, 2012
1686	great products	The product was as promised and provides a great price over brick and mortar retailers. The product provides a clean fresh air with great assurance through the 3M brand. Will be back to buy on Amazon for these product when needed.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 3, 2012
1687	Filters are perfect	Filters are perfect for our furnace.  They were shipped in record time.  Clean, new, reasonable price and best of all the furnace seems happy.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 14, 2012
1688	Nice deal!	Getting this product for the second time...beats store prices. Order from the convenience of your home...can't go wrong...works great! Recommend to anyone looking to purchase filters.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on May 3, 2012
1689	These used to be great; 3M has decided to bait-and-switch by making the product worse	I've been using these filters for years and have virtually zero dust to speak of.  The individual bags they come in are easy to tear open straight across the top so you can slide your used filter into it (avoiding getting dust all over the place).Don't get suckered into thinking the more expensive, higher MPR-rating filters are the way to go, unless you know you need them.  I use the 300-rated filters and it's plenty for the vast majority of people.  Higher rated filters will only reduce the efficiency of your heating and A/C systems and end up costing you more for the filters and in utility costs.  A tip I was taught to improve your filter's MPR rating without impacting air flow is to give the filter a quick spray with Pam (or similar) each time you replace the filter.  It will attract even more particles to the filter.Oh, and the box these come in has a tear-off portion so that it serves as a dispenser for the filters - nice bonus feature!  (as of 2014, this feature no longer seems to exist)UPDATE: as of late 2013, it seems like 3M has decided to save some money and produce a *dramatically* inferior product.  There is now very inconsistent fiber coverage -- to the point where there are rather large gaps that clearly won't capture dust.  Because of this change, I've dropped my 5-star rating to 3-stars.UPDATE 2: it is now mid-2014. My most recent box still seems inferior from the original product I had been ordering for years, but there seems to be less inconsistency in the product compared with the box that prompted my update above.  Based on this, I am sufficiently satisfied and will keep ordering and will continue to update my review based on what I find.  If the next box is ok I may bump up the stars, but for now I'm still concerned there may be significant variability in the quality of the product and am leaving at 3-stars.UPDATE 3: it is January 2015 and I am now officially giving up on these filters and dropping the review to 2-stars.  The most recent filter I used wasn't strong enough to resist the air going through it and completely flattened in the vent - completely defeating the purpose of the ridges and presumably reducing the efficiency of the furnace.  I've also noticed a marked increase in the amount of dust in my house, though there are other possible reasons there and it may or may not be the filters .  If these filters were as cheap as the no-name ones you can find at any store then they'd be adequate, but these just aren't worth $6/filter.  As much as I want to switch brands entirely, I am giving 3M's 600 MPR filters a chance first (Filtrete Clean Living Dust Reduction Filters, 600 MPR, 20 x 25 x 1, 6-Pack).  3M claims they provide better filtration AND are more efficient at allowing air through then the 300 MPR filter, which makes very little sense, but, OK.  At first glance they seem a lot like the 300 MPR filters used to be before the quality went downhill.  I'm a bit concerned the construction doesn't seem any more solid and so it may also flatten, but at least the fiber coverage is more consistent, and even the exterior packaging is more like the quality of the old ones that generated my initial review. I'll put up a review of those ones in a couple months after I've had a chance to evaluate them.UPDATE 4: It's January 2016 and I've made the switch to the comparable Nordic Pure product (Nordic Pure 16x25x1M8-6 MERV 8 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filter, 16x25x1, Box of 6).  The 3M product I linked in Update #3 was better than the product on this page, but still not even as good as these were in the past.  In contrast, the Nordic Pure product has consistent coverage but is structurally way stronger than the 3M product.  No flattening, no difficulties getting it in and out of the vent.  Wish I had switched earlier.	2.0 out of 5 stars	on April 29, 2012

1692	Filters	Filters arrived promptly and were as advertized.  They installed well and fit properly in our ceiling opening.  So far they are working well - - we have used 3M in the past and been very satisfied with them.  Price was right and with no shipping charge it is a no brainer.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on March 2, 2012

1695	Nothing To See Here	This one gets my standard short spiel for "everyday" orders that simply function as advertised: This item satisfied my requirements and/or "worked" as it was supposed to.  It presented neither apparent defects, nor did it significantly exceed my expectations.  As a result, I offer this item 4 stars (a.k.a. "I Like It").	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 17, 2011

1697	Dust be gone!	These Filtrete filters do their job great and for a great value.  With a dog and a cat, a clean filter is a must.  I know it is only 300MPR, but anything much higher and my A/C really struggles and would freeze do to the restricted airflow.  I replace mine every 3 months and to be able to buy them in a pack of 6 that I can keep by the furnace ensures I will always have a fresh one ready to install.  I'm always amazed at how much this filter picks up.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on November 21, 2011
1698	Good price	Filtrete is a very reliable filter. The best thing about this is having a supply on hand and the price is much cheaper than in the stores.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 28, 2011
1699	Great value and excellent product!	We love this filter since it is perfect for air handlers with the odd size of 14 x 30.  There is really no need for anything more extravagant since this filter will not impede air flow like the more expensive versions of this same filter.Delivery was great with Amazon Prime (arrived in 1 day due to our proximity to an Amazon prime distribution center).	5.0 out of 5 stars	on October 11, 2011
1700	Excellent!	Seller is excellent. Received filters in a prompt manner. Filters are great, believe it or not, but the qualityof the air in my apartment has improved. We have always used 3M filters but i love these... Price/quality!!!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 30, 2011
1701	No one had my filter size BUT Amazon!	No one had my filter size but Amazon!I have a 50+ home with a really wierd sized filter for the air flow. The local hardware store in my neighborhood stopped carrying the sizes I needed; 20 x 24 x 1. The first placed I used was Amazon. I had been using a do-it-yourself cut-to-size filter for the last year. We have been getting sick and the house as been dustier than it ever has been. Since getting this filter from amazon we have less dust and I can tell that I can breathe easier. Plus I feel better that my infant daughter is finally getting filtered air.The price is awesome, even the normal size filters and regualr stores around me run 8-10 bucks. I got these for a steal and they'll last me the next 1-2 years.  I definitely recommend these to anyone.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on September 28, 2011
1702	Amazing Filters!	My husband and I have horrible allergies! in just one night, this filter reduced the pollen levels of a texas summer to completely manageable. I can't wait to see what these will do as we keep using them!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on August 24, 2011
1703	3M Dust reduction air filter	In my area (Western NC) 18 x 18 air filters are uncommon, so I was very glad I thought to check amazon.com.I haven't had it long enough to know whether it lasts, but it certainly has improved the air quality in our office.The product arrived in good time and in excellent condition. I am quite satisfied.MGC	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 30, 2011
1704	So glad I found these on Amazon.com!	We have two air returns in our house, and the smaller one is this 12x12x1 size. I used to be able to buy those filters at a regular discount store, but recently all the stores in my town have stopped carrying this size. I was about to give up and buy of of the filters that you cut to size when someone suggested that I try Amazon.com. I was so happy to see they had them. The price was comparable to buying them separately, and now I don't have to worry about buying more for 6 months.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on July 7, 2011
1705	12x12x1" Fit Problem	I usually buy these (or other) filters locally, however Amazon has a good price for the 6-pack of 12x12x1". I generally have no problem with the quality of these and would rate them 4-5 stars, however I think Filtrete has a bad batch here, since the ones I received are about a 1/4" too big in length and width (thickness is fine). I really had to force them into place. Hopefully, I'll be able to get them back out when the time comes, without dislodging all the dust back into the room!	2.0 out of 5 stars	on April 16, 2011
1706	Good to go	The shipping box was well built and secure. Each filter is individually sealed in plastic. I installed the filters (my system has 2 intakes) with the AC running.  I did not notice any increased pressure when I removed a 3 day old cheap fiberglass filter and installed this one. Was this a scientific measurement, no. Do I have confidence in my assessment, yes.  Like many people I was concerned about increased pressure on the system.  It is my belief the Filtrete 300 does not put any more strain on the unit than the cheapo fiberglass filter. I plan to try the Filtrete 600 the next time I need filters but will not go any higher than that.	5.0 out of 5 stars	on April 1, 2011

1709	Great Filters - I love Amazon!	These are perfect.  I searched Lowes and Home Depot for this special size and had no luck.  On a lark I figured that I would check Amazon and was surprised to find them with free (Prime) shipping.  Amazon made my day and now my air conditioner is running much better with this new supply of fresh, high quality filters.  Thank you Amazon!	5.0 out of 5 stars	on June 29, 2010
1710	Good filters for the price	Bought a house in 06 and haven't changed the filters one time since moving in.  Bought the 6 pack and replaced the ones in my house.  They all work well just as specified.  No Complaints!These are good filters, but if you are specially prone to allergy problems, I would recommend upgrading to a better micro-allergen filter.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on January 14, 2010
1711	filters	I've been using these filters for a few years now, they do a good job keeping the gunk out of my ac system. I have pets so the filters have to deal with tons of dog and cat hair, and I'm highly allergic to dust mite debris, so I appreciate the extra work these suckers do. I change mine about twice a year, instead of the 4 they recommend, but give it a light vacuuming every now and then to prolong it's life. They are a little more expensive, but I'm happy to pay for the hard to find size that fits my house, and enjoy the extra dust reducing benefits along the way.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on December 28, 2009
1712	Works great and doesn't have parts that get stuck on my ductwork	This filter does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a good value.  The slot my filter goes into is a bit tighter than it should be and the last set of filters used to have carboard strapping that would get stuck on the ductwork.  This doesn't have that and it fits perfectly - even though it is the same size as my old filters.When I pull it out after three months it is dirty, so I assume it is doing its job.  I haven't noticed any increase/decrease in my utility bills, so I don't think it is overly restrictive.OK.  That is about as much detail as I can give in a review of a paper filter.	4.0 out of 5 stars	on September 22, 2009
