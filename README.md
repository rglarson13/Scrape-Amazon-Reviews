# Scrape Amazon Reviews

At present, this is just a simple script to scrape the top X reviews for a product by ASIN.

I intend to expand the functionality of this a bit, to iterate through a list of ASINs (maybe read from a CSV, or at least a simple TXT list), and at the very least I need to do a proper API implementation so Amazon won't block the scraper.

I also want to do some text analysis of the scraped reviews -- tokenize things, maybe use a Bag of Words model to find common themes, run a sentiment analysis, etc.

But it's Saturday afternoon and it's the first sunny day after a week of rain, so that'll have to wait.
